      <p>
          I am a second year studying Computer Science at California State University, 
          Fullerton. I love learning in general and have a passion for technology. 
          My early exposure of computers has led me to take classes throughout 
          junior high, high school, and college. The never ending growth of 
          technology inspires me to learn more about how and why it works.
          Currently, I am working on multiple jobs, projects, and 
          extracurriculars related to my major.

                  <h4>National Park Service Information Kiosk</h4>
                  <p>
                      This project is a web application that was submitted to Capital 
                      One's MindSumo Challenge. This web applicationâ€™s purpose is to 
                      help users find information involving the national parks in the 
                      United States by using the National Park Service API. The project 
                      utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a visual 
                      interface to search information through the National Park Service 
                      API. The website is responsive to any device and adjusts its 
                      layout accordingly, allowing mobile devices to access this 
                      website as well.

                  <h4>Summer 2019 Research</h4>
                  <p>
                      With the CSU Fullerton's organization, ASSURE-US, I researched 
                      concepts involving data science using Python and Jupyter notebook 
                      by completing a small-scale data science project on a topic of 
                      preference to understand the mathematics behind data science. 
                      My research discovered which factor within college admissions is 
                      the best indicator in predicting salary earnings.

                  <p>
                      Hackathon project that allows users to help people search for 
                      drivers from a start destination to an end destination. I 
                      focused on front-end work using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and 
                      JavaScript to create the website.

                  <h4>Agenda</h4>
                  <p>
                      This project is an online agenda that uses the 
                      local storage of a browser to store to-do list 
                      items for a templsted week in a minimalistic way. 
                      I plan to expand this to reflect the month and 
                      years while incorpoating some other productive 
                      habits.

                  <h4>HTML/CSS Tutorial Website</h4>
                  <p>
                      This website is a quick quide to explain the 
                      basics of HTML and CSS. I provide information
                      on the structure and a description of common 
                      tags. I plan to expand this idea later on by
                      adding JavaScript and other technologies and 
                      frameworks such as Bootstrap and more. I would 
                      hope that this website would be used in future 
                      projects to quickly understand the core concepts 
                      to ease time constraints.

                  <h4>Computer Science Fundamentals Website</h4>
                  <p>
                      I plan to make a website based on the knowledge
                      I learned throughout my college years. This will
                      incorporate the basic and core classes of computer
                      science such as object-oriented programming, data 
                      structures, operating systems, and more. My main goal
                      for this program is to help future students understand 
                      the expectations of the major and give them a headstart 
                      in their learning.

                      I will be creating an inventory management system using
                      Flask, Firebase, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with
                      four other members.

          One of my favorite places to go is the library to study and 
          learn new things. I also like to go to malls and parks in 
          my free time.

      <h2>What I Like to Photograph</h2>
      <p>
          I take these photos to recall memories I had with the pictures.
          The main pictures I like to take are of my family and friends. 
          I take these photos to recall memories I had with the pictures. 
          Later on, I plan to compile these photos and make an album to 
          reminisce throughout my life. My family would often make albums 
          of their children when they were younger, and I want to do the 
          same, but throughout life.
      </p>
      <p>
          I also like to take pictures of animals and nature. Most of my 
          pictures of cats that I find throughout my neighborhood. 
          Unfortunately, most of the pictures are blurry since they run 
          away. Aside from that, I also like to take pictures of nature and 
          scenery. Looking back on these pictures make me feel at peace. I 
          would like to make an album in the future to revisit all the views 
          I have seen throughout my life.

      <h2>Hidden Talent: Time Management - Blog Posts</p>
      <h3>2/20/20</h3>
      <p>
          I started the day off by working on my portfolio for the 
          Google SPS program. Since I was thinking about what I should 
          put throughout the week, the inputting the text was not too 
          difficult. Once I arrived at school, I went to retrieve the 
          homework I needed to grade over the weekend. I then studied 
          a bit more for my quiz for one of my classes today and organized 
          one of my organization's drive as a proposal to help with managing 
          files before I headed to class. I then reviewed a pull request for 
          my research project and continued to study for my quiz. Afterwards, 
          I went to class then worked more on the SPS portfolio website while 
          waiting for my fifth class. Once my fifth class finished, I worked 
          more on the SPS portfolio website since the cloudshell wasn't 
          saving the changes I was making in the afternoon. I then went to 
          one of my club meetings for a major summit event we are planning the
          first Friday of March of 2020. I then finished most of the SPS website 
          at this point since I found out that my error was me changing the 
          wrong files. Before going to bed, I made minor adjustments to my 
          flutter mobile research project and created logos for one of the 
          organization I am in. 
      </p>
      <h3>2/19/20</h3>
      <p>
          Starting my day at 4am, I went to work and had to reinstall
          all of my software on my new computer with another individual. 
          I was able to finish a task given to me and submitted a pull 
          request while also finishing half way of another task. 
          Afterwards, I went to run errands then returned home at 7pm. 
          Then, I worked on my research project to make small adjustments 
          to the design. Since there was not much communication within my 
          group, I began to look into some of the code written by others 
          to modify for future reference. Later on, I created pull request 
          which was accepted. Later on, I made other minor adjustments 
          before studying for my quiz until 10pm. 
      </p>
      <h3>2/18/20</h3>
      <p>
          At the start of the day, I started to finalize my features for 
          flutter mobile research project. I was able to create my nutritonal 
          calculator before my first class. Afterwards, I worked three hours 
          on my mobile project finalizing the embedded website and the 
          additional screen. Then, I went to my classes and began installing 
          my environment for my software engineering Flask inventory tracking 
          system project. Exhausted from programming five hours while studying 
          for classses, I slept early this day in preparation of my work at 4am 
          the following day.
